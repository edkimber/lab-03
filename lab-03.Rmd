# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_

Not respecting data with the 1,026 billion figure, should be million not billion so this is wrong. The size of the bars aren't proportional to the data so isn't respecting the people viewing it or the mathematics behind it.



## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_

This is disrespecting the data and the people as it is not an appropriate visualisation style making it unclear what its showing, not letting the data speak. It is visually boring which makes it unattractive for the viewer.


## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

Visualisation style makes it difficult for people to understand, no legend to describe the colours and their meaning. No axis values, not respecting the data.


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_

The visualisation type is very messy/unclear. The y-axis is not appropriate and it makes reading the data difficult.


# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
Long format data is where every row is a data point. For instance, it will have the name of the person, the name of the measurement and the corresponding value. Wide format data is where you need to look at both the column and row to find the data point.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
Wide.

How many observations are there in the data set?
55.



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !faculty_type, 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

staff_long
```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()



```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}


staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "The Percentage of Faculty Types by Year", subtitle = "From 1975 to 2011", x = "Year", y = "Percentage makeup")



```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Make the two lines bold to draw attention
* Fill below (alpha)
* Use facet(wrap)
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "The Percentage of Faculty Types by Year", subtitle = "From 1975 to 2011", x = "Year", y = "Percentage makeup") + facet_wrap(~ faculty_type, scale = "free", ncol = 3) + theme(text = element_text(size = 7))

```
